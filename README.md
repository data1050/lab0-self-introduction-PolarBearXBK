Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 


Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a second year master's student in the DSI. I'm from Changsha, China; people from our area enjoy spicy food due to our relatively humid climate, so I've sort of gotten into the habit of doing that as well. I enjoy reading and doing a bit of art on occasions, I'm also a tenure dota 1 player, and I expect I'll be one of the people who get to witness the game die out in the recent future. It was great to meet you and I'm looking forward to the semester!
